Cappuccino
<p>
Cappucino:
<br>

It also known as a “traditional morning heart starter”. 
Basically, this hugely popular coffee drink was created to cater to people that liked cream in their coffee.  
<br>
A true cappuccino is a combination of equal parts espresso, steamed milk and milk froth.
<br> 
Cappucino always served in a preheated vitrified ceramic cup.

Americano
<p>
Americano:
<br>
American coffee is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. 
<br>
Its strength varies with the number of shots of espresso and amount of water added.

MOCHA
<p>
Mocha:
<br>
Although a mocha is often interpreted differently across the world, the basis is that a shot of espresso is combined with a chocolate powder or syrup, followed by milk or cream.
<br> 
It is a variant of a latte, in the sense that it is often 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk. 
<br>
However, a chocolate flavour is added, and this can be milk or dark.
